I am Ezra Johnson, a senior undergraduate computer science major at Caltech. Looking forward, I will conduct my Ph.D. on algorithms with focus on theoretical performance bounds and applications to social issues such as sustainability and fairness.

During my time at Caltech, I have been fortunate to work with Professors [R. Michael Alvarez](https://www.rmichaelalvarez.com/) and [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/). This summer, I was honored to be offered the opportunity to research at UMass Amherst under Professor [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/). I am grateful to have learned from these amazing researchers.
