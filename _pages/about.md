I am Ezra Johnson, a senior undergraduate computer science major at Caltech. Looking forward, I will pursue my Ph.D. in algorithms with focus on theoretical performance bounds with applications to social issues such as sustainability and fairness.

During my time at Caltech, I have been fortunate to work with Professors [R. Michael Alvarez](https://www.rmichaelalvarez.com/) and [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/). This summer, I was fortunate to be chosen to research at UMass Amherst under Professor [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/). I am incredibly grateful to have learned from these amazing researchers.
